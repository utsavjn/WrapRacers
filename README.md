 	OVERVIEW: WARP RACERS

Synopsis: Warp Racers is a space age 2.5D turn based multiplayer racing game that takes competitive players through different galaxies challenging them to collect objects and receive the most points possible while struggling to stay alive.

The game operates much like a standard foot race around a track in theory BUT players can go right or left, essentially two different tracks that end back at the same point. (See Document 1.B: If this concept is too hard we can do one singular track BUT it needs to have turns in it and may beed to have a few different layouts. Or it can be like doodle jump where you are just constantly moving forward down a wider singular track.)  Each level/lap is skinned differently and has different trials and tribulations such as faster speeds, more enemies and mines and if possible randomly generated asteroids. 

The Gameplay Theory: The aircraft will be stationary in the middle to lower part  of the screen and will be maneuvered by the player spinning the phone around using the accelerometer or on screen controls. The physics will be lagging behind slightly as if the aircraft was actually in space. (Almost a sliding like effect. Other space games reflect this as well.) There is no gas pedal as each level dictates the speed of the craft. The speed of the spacecraft is fixed but changes in each level, progressively getting faster.  (We want the aircraft to have thrusters behind them that are lively and explanations really emphasizing the 2.5d experience.) (Distance=Baseline for point accumulation, the further you go the more points you get.)  The players will have a health bar representing the aircraft's health. The health is only damaged by other computer controlled AI alien aircraft shooting and hitting you or or going out of bounds, or being hit by a mine. (These mines are proximity mines and when set off can damage your spacecraft and or destroy other asteroids creating a chain reaction.) However, if you get hit by a large asteroid you are killed instantly and the race is over or you. (You can shoot asteroids and destroy them but the asteroids breaks into other smaller asteroids so watch out those fragments can kill your player as well.) Also be on the look out for pick ups like points (Crystals or diamonds) and special powers (Powerups).

You only have one life per race but if you die you can pay with points to keep moving forward only once. Each lap is the same in terms of layout (Depending on what we choose for layouts... (If this concept is too hard we can do one singular track BUT it needs to have turns in it and may need to have a few different layouts. Or it can be like doodle jump where you are just constantly moving forward down a wider singular track.)  the only thing that will change in each lap are the backgrounds and objects. See Document 1.D At the end of each lap there is  a stargate or black hole you are trying to get to which warps you to the next world/lap. The race does not end until the last player dies or runs out of fuel. Once they hit the end of level three they are catapulted back to level one but continue through until they die with the same speed as level 3 but gets progressively faster with each additional level passed so this will guarantee the player will die eventually, so each player will go through the levels and  it will look like this…. Players Levels 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 est. and the speed for those levels looks like this, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 est. The point is like doodle jump you will fail at some point, so get as high of a score as you can!

INGAME POINT SYSTEM/ECONOMICS: 

Multiplayer
 We want the game to work exactly like the game archery king. In terms of matching players (Is it possible to have player profiles? Like Archer Kings?)To match make with another racer and race you can enter into races which have buy in and winnings like archery king. And the prize is 900 (100 for the house) There will be 5 race classes to play in. Each class has higher rewards and buy ins. If they want more coins they can purchase them or watch video ads for the coins. Est.

Players Earn Scores For Playing:
Players get points for traveling distance in level + additional points for collecting diamonds and killing aliens and betting winnings.

Player can post on social media results for additional tokens. Sharing race scores 

Players Earned In Game Points Are SPENT On... 
Power ups, ships, in game restarts, bets, fuel and player restarts after a death. . 

Player's score is always changing based on what they are purchasing from the above. This dynamic score system will ensure competitive competition. 

(Earned Points) - (Spend Point)= Total playable points. There should be a scoreboard locally nationally and internationally? 

IN GAME REVENUE :
Ad Removal: We want ads to pop up during the game (Like banner ads during the race itself OR after the race a video.) or have videos play after the race ends. ($.99 to remove them from the user experience but they will always be there to get more tokens if necessary.
